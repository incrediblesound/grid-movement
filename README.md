grid-movement
=============
Grid movement explores the representation of location in space via JavaScript arrays. The idea is simple: There is a player and a computer controlled opponent who are located in a three by three grid. On even numbered turns the player can move up or down and on odd turns left or right. The computer, meanwhile, moves randomly through the grid one step at a time. If the player and the computer end up in the same square the player loses, and if the game progresses through ten turns the player wins.
